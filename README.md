# Mathematical LaTeX Document Generator

A hierarchical multi-agent system for automatically generating high-quality mathematics papers in LaTeX. This system uses a structured approach with multiple layers of specialized agents working together to create coherent, accurate mathematical content.

## üîç Overview

This project implements a collaborative bot system where each bot has a specialized role in the document creation process:

- **L1 Bot**: Handles high-level document construction and structure
- **L2 Bot**: Manages section-level writing 
- **L3 Bot**: Manages subsection-level writing
- **L4 Bot**: Creates mathematical content (theorems, lemmas, examples, etc.)
- **Review Bot**: Reviews mathematical content for accuracy

The system also includes a tournament mechanism to generate multiple candidate outputs and select the best ones through a round-robin competition.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system follows a hierarchical structure:

```
L1 Bot (Document)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ L2 Bot (Section)
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ L3 Bot (Subsection)
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ L4 Bot (Mathematical Content)
                 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Review Bot (Content Verification)
```

Each level operates with its own context and responsibilities:

1. **L1 Bot**: Structures the overall document, delegates section writing to L2 bots
2. **L2 Bot**: Creates sections, delegates subsection writing to L3 bots
3. **L3 Bot**: Creates subsections, delegates mathematical content to L4 bots
4. **L4 Bot**: Constructs mathematical environments (theorems, proofs, examples)
5. **Review Bot**: Performs multi-step review of mathematical content

## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Google Cloud API key with access to Gemini models

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justincasher/math_recursion
   cd math_recursion
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install google google-generativeai
   ```

3. Configure your API key:
   - Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable:
     ```bash
     export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
     ```
   - Or directly edit the `config.py` file (not recommended for security)

## üìù Usage

1. Place your initial LaTeX document or problem statement in a text file
2. Update the `config.py` file to point to your input and output files:
   ```python
   DOC_LOAD = "your_input_file.txt"
   DOC_SAVE = "your_output_file.txt"
   ```
3. Run the system:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. If `VISUALIZER` is enabled (default), a GUI will appear showing the document creation progress

## üñ•Ô∏è Visualizer

The system includes a visualization tool to monitor the document creation process:

- Left panel: Shows the current document/section/subsection content
- Right panel: Displays metadata, instructions, and navigation buttons
- Pause/Resume button: Controls the update process

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize the system behavior:

```python
# Basic configuration
DEFAULT_MODEL_NAME = "gemini-2.0-flash"  # LLM model to use
PARALLEL = True                          # Enable parallel processing
VISUALIZER = True                        # Enable visualization GUI

# Iteration limits
L1_REASONING_STEPS = 5                   # Maximum L1 bot iterations
L2_REASONING_STEPS = 2                   # Maximum L2 bot iterations
L3_REASONING_STEPS = 2                   # Maximum L3 bot iterations
L4_REASONING_STEPS = 2                   # Maximum L4 bot iterations

# Number of bots at each level for tournament selection
NUM_L2_BOTS = 1                          # Number of L2 bots
NUM_L3_BOTS = 1                          # Number of L3 bots
NUM_L4_BOTS = 3                          # Number of L4 bots
NUM_REVIEWERS = 3                        # Number of review bots

# IO configuration
DOC_LOAD = "test_problems/Putnam_2024_A6.txt"  # Input file
DOC_SAVE = "math_new.txt"                      # Output file
```
