Your goal is to solve the following problem:

Consider the function
$$
f(x) = \frac{1 - 3x - \sqrt{1 - 14x + 9x^2}}{4},
$$
where the square root is taken to be the positive branch near $ x=0 $. Since $ 1 - 14x + 9x^2 $ 
is nonzero at $ x=0 $, $ f $ is real-analytic in a neighborhood of $ 0 $. Therefore, there is 
a unique power series expansion
$$
f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k \, x^k.
$$
Let $ c_0, c_1, c_2, \ldots $ be the coefficients of this expansion. For a positive integer $ n $, 
let $ A $ be the $ n \times n $ matrix whose $ (i,j) $-entry is $ c_{i + j - 1} $ with $ i, j $
in $ {1, 2, \dots, n} $. 

Find $ \det(A) $.
